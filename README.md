### Tip: this mod currently only supports 1.16-1.16.4, because the agricultural and magical styles of the entire module are closely related to the newer Black Stone style of the 1.16 update.

### Things Added

#### Sweet Potato

    In this mod, a kind of food is added, called Sweet Potato. It has three categories: Purple Sweet Potato, Red Sweet Potato and White Sweet Potato, with three variants: Raw   Sweet Potato,Baked Sweet Potato and Enchanted Sweet Potato. You can get any variant of Sweet Potato by killing Zombies, Husks and Zombie Villagers. You can also look all over the world for treasure chests containing Sweet Potatoes. You can also plant any kind of Raw Sweet Potato on farmland to let it grow.
  
    Of course, you can also bake Sweet Potatoes. By putting any kind of Raw Sweet Potatoes into Furnaces, Smokers or on Campfires, you will get a Baked Sweet Potato. A Baked Sweet Potato can restore a large amount of hunger.
  
    Similar to Honey Bottles, you will receive a Peel after eating any variants of Sweet Potato.
  
    You can put a Sweet Potato into a Grinder to get a Sweet Potato Powder. In a future version, you can also put a Sweet Potato into an activated Magic Cube to have a chance to change the attributes of the Sweet Potato.
  
#### Sweet Potato Powder

    Sweet Potato Powder is an important item in the mod. You can grind any kind of Raw or Enchanted Sweet Potato in a Grinder to get Sweet Potato Powder.
  
    Sweet Potato Powder can upgrade Saplings into their Enchanted variants in an Agroforestry Table, increasing the growing speed of trees.
  
    In future versions, Sweet Potato Powder will also be a sublimator for Magic Cube for its work.
  
#### Peel

    When you consume any variants of Sweet Potato, you will get a Peel.
  
    You can feed them to your pigs.
  
    In future versions, it will be an important fuel of Magic Cubes.
  
#### Magic Cube

    The Magic Cube has a black texture. When activated, it will lit up with purple halo. You can activate the Magic Cube by lighting one or more Soul Fire in the 3x3 area below.
  
    In future versions, activated Magic Cube uses Peel for fuel and Sweet Potato Powder for sublimation. It has the function of transmitting a kind of Sweet Potato in to another one, or give it some random enchantments.
  
    Magic Cube is a cheap anti-explosion block. It has the same blast resistance as an Obsidian, but can be mined with an Iron Pickaxe.
  
#### Grinder

    Grinder’s function is to grind Sweet Potatoes into Sweet Potato Powder. By adding Raw or Enchanted Sweet Potatoes into a Grinder, it will add their respective ingredient data number to the total one. When the value accumulates to 15, the Sweet Potato will be ground into Sweet Potato Powder. Sweet Potato Powder can be used to upgrade Saplings in Agroforestry Tables. In future versions, it can also be used as sublimator in Magic Cubes.
  
#### Agroforestry Table

    The working place of Agroforestry Table is made of gold. When the Vanilla Saplings and Sweet Potato Powder are put into the Agroforestry Table, it can enchant the Saplings.  Enchanted saplings will grow much faster.
  
#### Enchant Saplings
    Enchanted Sapling has bright enchantment luster. It has six variants: Enchanted Oak Saplings, Enchanted Spruce Saplings, Enchanted Birch Saplings, Enchanted Jungle Saplings, Enchanted Acacia Saplings and Enchanted Dark Oak Saplings.
  
    You can use a Vanilla Sapling and Sweet Potato Powder to enchant a sapling in an Agroforestry Table. Enchanted Saplings can increase the growing speed of trees.
  
    Like the Vanilla Saplings, Enchanted Saplings can be placed in furnaces as fuel, and can be composted. Enchanted Oak Saplings and Enchanted Birch Saplings grow into trees that naturally spawn beehives.
